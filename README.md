# Traffic Automation System - Reinforcement Learning
In this repo, we provide an easy-to-use RL framework for a general dynamic traffic light control use. 
The models we proposed in this paper are universal and adaptable for all similar scenarios, and we hope that this project could raise awareness of government on adopting new technologies to improve the current inefficient traffic system and also systematically prevent people from being hurt by distracted driving and over-speeding.
